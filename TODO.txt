* Make it more platform agnostic.
Unfortunately, this fucking game's source code is somewhat obfuscated and the comments were in japanese,
making this task difficult.

Right now it relies on a configuration file being written somewhere. Said file is then read by the game.
There should be a way of allowing the game to run without it.

* Add support for the TI-Nspire CX, Dreamcast
Kind of related to the above.

* Port it to SDL2
Will be needed for Android port and other modern platforms. (Wayland and all)
